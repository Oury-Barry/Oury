#### Data and Sustainability Enthusiast
I am a Sustainable Mining MSc graduate from TU Bergakademie Freiberg. My research focuses on LIBS for real-time aluminium alloy sorting to support circular-economy goals. Covering every step of the workflow from planning experiments and pre-processing high-dimensioanal LIBS spectra (>40 0000 invdividual specral lines) to building and validating models to model development and validation to accuraly quantify key elements like Cu, Mn, Mg, Si, and Zn in aluminium alloys. I am passionate about applying data-driven approaches to sustainable resource management.
