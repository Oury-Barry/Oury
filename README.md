<h1>Hi there 👋, Oury Barry!<br/><a href="https://github.com/Oury-Barry"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barryoury/">Data and Sustainability Enthusiast</h1>

<div align="justify"> I am a Sustainable Mining MSc graduate from TU Bergakademie Freiberg. My research focuses on LIBS for real-time aluminium alloy sorting to support circular-economy goals. Covering every step of the workflow from planning experiments and pre-processing high-dimensioanal LIBS spectra (>40 0000 invdividual specral lines) to model development and validation to accuraly quantify key elements like Cu, Mn, Mg, Si, and Zn in aluminium alloys. I am passionate about applying data-driven approaches to sustainable resource management.</div><br></br>
